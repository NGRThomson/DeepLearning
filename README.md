# DeepLearning

This repo presents 3 assignments from the module Advanced Deep Learning taught by DeepMind at UCL. All code done in Tensorflow.

## Notebook 1

* 3 Feedforward Networks
* 1 Convolutional Network
* All computed on Mnist

## Notebook 2

* LSTM and GRU Networks to classify Mnist as a sequence

## Notebook 3

* N pixel predictions - Using an RNN, predict the next N pixels of a picture as sequence.
* Pixel Paint In - Fill in a single pixel or 2x2 pixels in a picture using RNNs.
* Learning tasks with RNN - Learning a distribution as a function of previous actions.

## NotMnist

This was an early project focused on hyper parameter tuning of a basic neural network. The dataset is the Not Mnist, a set of images of the letters A-J. I used HyperOpt and Hyperas to perform tuning, as well as looking into regularisers, acitvations and kernel initialisations.
